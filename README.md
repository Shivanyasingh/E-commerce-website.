An ecommerce project plan helps you get realistic about your budget, timeline, and capabilities and stay this way throughout the project.
Clear goals and objectives drive your project decisions, so it’s hard to go over the project scope unless you’re about to add some relevant functionalities.
It’s a way to keep your finger on the pulse of the project: to see whether the tasks are completed in order and on time to come at an expected release date.
Planning allows you to assess risks and reduce their impact on your project.
In the final phase of project management, the plan serves to analyze how well you’ve achieved your goals and what else needs to be done to bring value to your business.
